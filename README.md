# My_Dashboard
My_Dashboard was a project that allowed me to put my knowldge of CSS Grid Layout Module into practice.
While at this point in my software development journey I have also practiced CSS Flexbox, both layout styles have their
place and use cases. I did incorporate CSS Flexbox into this project as well, just to intertwine the two CSS layout modules
on the same overall layout.
